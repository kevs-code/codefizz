GIT TEAMWORK

git clone remote_location clone_name

A remote is a Git repository that lives outside your Git project folder. Remotes can live on the web, on a shared network or even in a separate folder on your local computer.
The Git Collaborative Workflow are steps that enable smooth project development when multiple collaborators are working on the same Git project.
We also learned the following commands

git clone: Creates a local copy of a remote.
git remote -v: Lists a Git project’s remotes.
git fetch: Fetches work from the remote into the local copy.
git merge origin/master: Merges origin/master into your local branch.
git push origin <branch_name>: Pushes a local branch to the origin remote.
