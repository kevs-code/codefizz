MULTIPLE TABLES
Introduction
In order to efficiently store data, we often spread related information across multiple tables.

For instance, imagine that we’re running a magazine company where users can have different types of subscriptions to different products. Different subscriptions might have many different properties. Each customer would also have lots of associated information.

We could have one table with all of the following information:

order_id
customer_id
customer_name
customer_address
subscription_id
subscription_description
subscription_monthly_price
subscription_length
purchase_date
However, a lot of this information would be repeated. If the same customer has multiple subscriptions, that customer’s name and address will be reported multiple times. If the same subscription type is ordered by multiple customers, then the subscription price and subscription description will be repeated. This will make our table big and unmanageable.

So instead, we can split our data into three tables:

1. orders would contain just the information necessary to describe what was ordered:

order_id, customer_id, subscription_id, purchase_date
2. subscriptions would contain the information to describe each type of subscription:

subscription_id, description, price_per_month, subscription_length
3. customers would contain the information for each customer:

customer_id, customer_name, address
In this lesson, we’ll learn the SQL commands that will help us work with data that is stored in multiple tables.


Combining Tables Manually
Let’s return to our magazine company. Suppose we have the three tables described in the previous exercise – shown in the browser on the right (we are going to try something new!):

orders
subscriptions
customers
If we just look at the orders table, we can’t really tell what’s happened in each order. However, if we refer to the other tables, we can get a complete picture.

Let’s examine the order with an order_id of 2. It was purchased by the customer with a customer_id of 2.

To find out the customer’s name, we look at the customers table and look for the item with a customer_id value of 2. We can see that Customer 2’s name is ‘Jane Doe’ and that she lives at ‘456 Park Ave’.

Doing this kind of matching is called joining two tables.


Inner Joins
Let’s revisit how we joined orders and customers. For every possible value of customer_id in orders, there was a corresponding row of customers with the same customer_id.

What if that wasn’t true?

For instance, imagine that our customers table was out of date, and was missing any information on customer 11. If that customer had an order in orders, what would happen when we joined the tables?

When we perform a simple JOIN (often called an inner join) our result only includes rows that match our ON condition.

Consider the following animation, which illustrates an inner join of two tables on table1.c2 = table2.c2:

￼

The first and last rows have matching values of c2. The middle rows do not match. The final result has all values from the first and last rows but does not include the non-matching middle row.


Left Joins
What if we want to combine two tables and keep some of the un-matched rows?

SQL lets us do this through a command called LEFT JOIN. A left join will keep all rows from the first table, regardless of whether there is a matching row in the second table.

Consider the following animation:

￼

The first and last rows have matching values of c2. The middle rows do not match. The final result will keep all rows of the first table but will omit the un-matched row from the second table.

This animation represents a table operation produced by the following command:

SELECT *
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
  ON table1.c2 = table2.c2;
The first line selects all columns from both tables.
The second line selects table1 (the “left” table).
The third line performs a LEFT JOIN on table2 (the “right” table).
The fourth line tells SQL how to perform the join (by looking for matching values in column c2).

MULTIPLE TABLES
Primary Key vs Foreign Key
Let’s return to our example of the magazine subscriptions. Recall that we had three tables: orders, subscriptions, and customers.

Each of these tables has a column that uniquely identifies each row of that table:

order_id for orders
subscription_id for subscriptions
customer_id for customers
These special columns are called primary keys.

Primary keys have a few requirements:

None of the values can be NULL.
Each value must be unique (i.e., you can’t have two customers with the same customer_id in the customers table).
A table can not have more than one primary key column.
Let’s reexamine the orders table:

order_id	customer_id	subscription_id	purchase_date
1	2	3	2017-01-01
2	2	2	2017-01-01
3	3	1	2017-01-01

Note that customer_id (the primary key for customers) and subscription_id (the primary key for subscriptions) both appear in this.

When the primary key for one table appears in a different table, it is called a foreign key.

So customer_id is a primary key when it appears in customers, but a foreign key when it appears in orders.

In this example, our primary keys all had somewhat descriptive names. Generally, the primary key will just be called id. Foreign keys will have more descriptive names.

Why is this important? The most common types of joins will be joining a foreign key from one table with the primary key from another table. For instance, when we join orders and customers, we join on customer_id, which is a foreign key in orders and the primary key in customers.

MULTIPLE TABLES
Cross Join
So far, we’ve focused on matching rows that have some information in common.

Sometimes, we just want to combine all rows of one table with all rows of another table.

For instance, if we had a table of shirts and a table of pants, we might want to know all the possible combinations to create different outfits.

Our code might look like this:

SELECT shirts.shirt_color,
   pants.pants_color
FROM shirts
CROSS JOIN pants;
The first two lines select the columns shirt_color and pants_color.
The third line pulls data from the table shirts.
The fourth line performs a CROSS JOIN with pants.
Notice that cross joins don’t require an ON statement. You’re not really joining on any columns!

If we have 3 different shirts (white, grey, and olive) and 2 different pants (light denim and black), the results might look like this:

shirt_color	pants_color
white	light denim
white	black
grey	light denim
grey	black
olive	light denim
olive	black

3 shirts × 2 pants = 6 combinations!

This clothing example is fun, but it’s not very practically useful.

A more common usage of CROSS JOIN is when we need to compare each row of a table to a list of values.

Let’s return to our newspaper subscriptions. This table contains two columns that we haven’t discussed yet:

start_month: the first month where the customer subscribed to the print newspaper (i.e., 2 for February)
end_month: the final month where the customer subscribed to the print newspaper
Suppose we wanted to know how many users were subscribed during each month of the year. For each month (1, 2, 3) we would need to know if a user was subscribed. Follow the steps below to see how we can use a CROSS JOIN to solve this problem.

Instructions
1.
Eventually, we’ll use a cross join to help us, but first, let’s try a simpler problem.

Let’s start by counting the number of customers who were subscribed to the newspaper during March.

Use COUNT(*) to count the number of rows and a WHERE clause to restrict to two conditions:

start_month <= 3
end_month >= 3

2.
Don’t remove the previous query.

The previous query lets us investigate one month at a time. In order to check across all months, we’re going to need to use a cross join.

Our database contains another table called months which contains the numbers between 1 and 12.

Select all columns from the cross join of newspaper and months.

￼

3.
Don’t remove your previous queries.

Create a third query where you add a WHERE statement to your cross join to restrict to two conditions:

start_month <= month
end_month >= month
This will select all months where a user was subscribed.

￼
Stuck? Get a hint
4.
Don’t remove your previous queries.

Create a final query where you aggregate over each month to count the number of subscribers.

Fill in the blanks in the following query:

SELECT month,
  COUNT(*)
FROM ________
CROSS JOIN ________
WHERE ________ AND ________
GROUP BY ________;



Suppose we have two tables and they have the same columns.

table1:

pokemon	type
Bulbasaur	Grass
Charmander	Fire
Squirtle	Water

table2:

pokemon	type
Snorlax	Normal

If we combine these two with UNION:

SELECT *
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT *
FROM table2;
The result would be:

pokemon	type
Bulbasaur	Grass
Charmander	Fire
Squirtle	Water
Snorlax	Normal

SQL has strict rules for appending data:

Tables must have the same number of columns.
The columns must have the same data types in the same order as the first table.
Instructions
1.
Let’s return to our newspaper and online subscriptions. We’d like to create one big table with both sets of data.

Use UNION to stack the newspaper table on top of the online table.

With
Often times, we want to combine two tables, but one of the tables is the result of another calculation.

Let’s return to our magazine order example. Our marketing department might want to know a bit more about our customers. For instance, they might want to know how many magazines each customer subscribes to. We can easily calculate this using our orders table:

SELECT customer_id,
   COUNT(subscription_id) AS 'subscriptions'
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
This query is good, but a customer_id isn’t terribly useful for our marketing department, they probably want to know the customer’s name.

We want to be able to join the results of this query with our customers table, which will tell us the name of each customer. We can do this by using a WITH clause.

WITH previous_results AS (
   SELECT ...
   ...
   ...
   ...
)
SELECT *
FROM previous_results
JOIN customers
  ON _____ = _____;
The WITH statement allows us to perform a separate query (such as aggregating customer’s subscriptions)
previous_results is the alias that we will use to reference any columns from the query inside of the WITH clause
We can then go on to do whatever we want with this temporary table (such as join the temporary table with another table)
Essentially, we are putting a whole first query inside the parentheses () and giving it a name. After that, we can use this name as if it’s a table and write a new query using the first query.

Instructions
1.
Place the whole query below into a WITH statement, inside parentheses (), and give it name previous_query:

SELECT customer_id,
   COUNT(subscription_id) AS 'subscriptions'
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
Join the temporary table previous_query with customers table and select the following columns:

customers.customer_name
previous_query.subscriptions
Check the answer in the hint below.

MULTIPLE TABLES
Review
In this lesson, we learned about relationships between tables in relational databases and how to query information from multiple tables using SQL.

Let’s summarize what we’ve learned so far:

JOIN will combine rows from different tables if the join condition is true.

LEFT JOIN will return every row in the left table, and if the join condition is not met, NULL values are used to fill in the columns from the right table.

Primary key is a column that serves a unique identifier for the rows in the table.

Foreign key is a column that contains the primary key to another table.

CROSS JOIN lets us combine all rows of one table with all rows of another table.

UNION stacks one dataset on top of another.

WITH allows us to define one or more temporary tables that can be used in the final query.
