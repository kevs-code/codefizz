TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT WITH JAVASCRIPT
Quote Keeper
In this project, you will write a feature test for the development of a web application that allows users to save and display a collection of their favorite quotes. We will call this app “Quote Keeper”.

Quote Keeper should allow users to enter the following information about each quote they would like to save to the app:

The quote itself
Who the quote is attributed to
The source of the quote:
Book
Article
Speech
IRL
Because this course focuses on feature tests at the top level of the TDD Testing Pyramid, this project will only cover the feature tests process up to the point of getting an error about the exercise phase of your test suite. In order to progress we would need to drop down to the server layer of the Testing Pyramid, which is covered in another course. The completed form of this project will have a feature test suite that is ready to move on to tests at the server level.

The steps below will guide you through the process of using TDD to write a feature test for the Quote Keeper web app.

After you complete each step, run your test suite in the terminal to see the results of your test and evaluate what code to write next in response to the message.
