Deleting Old Expressions
DELETE is the HTTP method verb used to delete resources. Because DELETE routes delete currently existing data, their paths should usually end with a route parameter to indicate which resource to delete.

Express uses .delete() as its method for DELETE requests.

Servers often send a 204 No Content status code if deletion occurs without error.

Instructions
1.
Create a DELETE /expressions/:id route. It should send back a 404 response for a request with an invalid id, and it should delete the proper element from the expressions array and send a 204 status with a valid id.

To test your functionality, use the DELETE tab in the upper left. Select the ID to delete and send the request.
