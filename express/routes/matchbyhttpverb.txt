Matching By HTTP Verb
Express matches routes using both path and HTTP method verb. In the diagram to the right, we see a request with a PUT verb and /expressions (remember that the query is not part of the route path). The path for the first route matches, but the method verb is wrong, so the Express server will continue to the next registered route. This route matches both method and path, and so its callback is called, the necessary updating logic is executed, and the response is sent.
